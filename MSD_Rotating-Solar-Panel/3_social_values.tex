Still in 2020, electricity city is not available is most of the rural place in both our country and around the globe, mostly because of it's expensiveness. And also it's hard for rural people to afford electricity. Solar panels specially those can track sun and generate usable electricity, can be much helpful for rural places because these are not only cheap but also easy to use and setup.\\
Not only in the rooftop of rural houses, solar panel can be used in radio and TV station, schools and clinics which can drastically change the whole atmosphere of the a certain area, and if the panel can move along with the position of the sun we can generate much electricity.
