As climate change is becoming a threat for both the human and nature, energies that are created by releasing greenhouse gas is not a profound way to deal with the climate change. As solar energy is basically the most pure energy because there is no greenhouse gas emission releasing therefore we can fight against the climate change using solar panel to create as much electricity we need.\\
Problems with solar panel that is used mostly is it's faced in one side and doesn't change its axis according to sun, that's why it can't use it's full potential and produce as much as electricity that is needed. To solve this problem, single axis solar tracker that can rotate itself according to the suns position becomes very helpful and can generate much electricity from solar energy.
