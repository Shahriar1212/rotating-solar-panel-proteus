\section*{Working Procedure}
Two Light Dependent Resistors (LDR) will be connected with the both side of a solar panel. And when light falls on the panel LDR will change its register's value according to the light intensity. The value will passed on Micro controller (Arduino UNO) and it'll generate a signal and pass to the Motor driver. This signal will tell the gear motor driver in which way to rotate: clock-wise or anti-clockwise and along with the motor the solar panel will rotate towards the light.\\

Now the energy generated by solar panel will be passed through the TP4056 Battery Charger which will be connected to the LIPO Battery. Thus we will convert the clean solar energy to the Electric energy.\\
Along with this system, we will use DHT11 humidity-temperature sensor with Arduino UNO and collect the temperature and humidity around us show it to the LCD Display panel which is also connect to the micro-controller.
